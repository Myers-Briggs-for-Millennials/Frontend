A more stream-lined Myers-Briggs-esque personality test. The user can answer questions with the slider and receive a personality type result. I contributed to this project as a Front End Developer on a 24hr hackathon team. I also edited and narrated our marketing video. Technologies used include React, react-router, styled-components, and Material UI
