        name: 'Architect',
        description: `INTJ stands for Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging. This personality type is withdrawn, intellectual, reflective, unconventional, abstract, insightful and methodical. These people are typically hard to read and tend to come across as dispassionate, unemotional, quirky, yet very self-controlled. Their most treasured pursuit is the one for knowledge, for the fundamental truth behind appearances and INTJs have a natural flair for seeking, discerning and understanding the very essence of things. While on the outside, they often appear to be logical, cautious, rational and skeptical individuals, their inner life of the mind is rich beyond belief with symbols, meaning and innovative visions of the future. Although often brilliant and ahead of their time, they are sometimes perceived by their peers as being rather strange, arrogant and distant.`,

        description: `INTP stands for Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving. This personality type is known for being intellectual, abstract, logical, reserved, detached, random and skeptical. Such people are usually unconventional and highly theoretical, they like playing with ideas and coming up with ingenious thought systems and explanations for the events they observe, although they aren't too likely to share their discoveries, as they're quite socially withdrawn and secretive. INTPs are also objective, spontaneous, adaptable and highly independent; they often question authority, openly disregard social conventions and irrational customs and prefer to think for themselves, which can lead to an original, avant-garde vision of things, but also to being perceived as arrogant, cold and eccentric.`,

This very aspect can make some people regard them as unpredictable, insensitive and egotistical.`,
